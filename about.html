            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>In 2011, SM Entertainment CEO Lee Soo-man revealed plans to debut a new boy band that would be divided into two sub-groups, promoting the same music simultaneously in South Korea and China by performing songs in both Korean and Mandarin. After several lineup changes in December 2011, the group finalized its name as Exo, taken from the word "exoplanet".[3] The news of an upcoming debut from SM Entertainment attracted substantial media attention from within South Korea and internationally, with many comparing Exo to fellow SM boy band TVXQ. It was also reported that Exo would compete with a new girl group from rival YG Entertainment.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Exo-K and Exo-M debuted with the single "Mama" on April 8, 2012, followed by the EP Mama on April 9. The two sub-groups promoted the album separately; Exo-K performed on South Korean music program Inkigayo, while Exo-M performed on the Top Chinese Music Awards in Shenzhen on the same day. The Korean version of the EP peaked at number one on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart and at number eight on the Billboard World Albums Chart, while the Mandarin version reached number two on China's Sina Album Chart and number one on various Chinese streaming platforms. Prior their debut, Exo released two singles, "What Is Love" and "History", which peaked at numbers 88 and 68, respectively, on the Gaon Digital Chart and at number six on the Sina Music Chart. Exo was awarded Best New Asian Group at the 2012 Mnet Asian Music Awards and the Newcomer Award at the Golden Disc Awards.</p>
            <p>The group's first studio album, XOXO, was released on June 3, 2013, in two versions: one in Korean and one in Mandarin. XOXO was jointly promoted by both sub-units. Exo recorded the album's lead single "Wolf" together, although the rest of the album tracks were recorded separately. A repackaged version of the album, Growl, was released on August 5, 2013, with three additional tracks. All versions of XOXO collectively sold over one million copies, making Exo the first South Korean artists to reach that milestone in 12 years. That December, Exo released a second EP, Miracles in December, as a special winter album containing the single of the same name. Prior to the release, the group promoted the album through their first reality show, Exo's Showtime, which premiered on November 28, 2013. Following their 2013 releases, Exo won several awards, including Song of the Year at the Melon Music Awards for "Growl" and Album of the Year at the Mnet Asian Music Awards for XOXO.            </p>
